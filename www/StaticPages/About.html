<br><br>The development of  the SMIPS National Soil Moisture products and the creation of this web site has been made possible by funding from the 
<a href="http://www.nrm.gov.au/">National Landcare Program</a>, through the <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.au/"> Department of Agriculture and Water Resources</a>.

<h2>SMIPS</h2>
<p>This information page is still in development</p>
<p>
The Soil Soil Moisture Processing System (SMIPS) make a number of modeled estimates of national soil water estimates freely available. 
It also makes a number of soil moisture probe data sets freely available.
</p>
<p>
The development of this system has been funded by the National Landcare program, along with CSIRO. All products are considered experimental and should be used with caution.

Soil Moisture Map Products
Currently there are 2 national soil moisture map products available in SMIPS

<h3>
The Soil Moisture Index
</h3>
<p>
Soil Moisture Integration and Prediction system (SMIPS) continuously generating 1-km root-zone moisture estimates for Australia in near real-time.
 Integrates satellite data into a simple modelling framework. 
GPM IMERG 3B-HHR near-real-time satellite rainfall estimates statistically blended with BoM automatic weather station (AWS) to generate daily rainfall for the country at 1-km. 
Antecedent precipitation index (API) basic AR(1) time series used to model surface soil layer moisture dynamics.
SMOS satellite top-layer soil moisture retrievals (L2SM) assimilated into API model.
API scaled between time series (1997-2012) min and max values to computewetness of top-layer
Exponential filter (recursive formulation) applied to wetness data to get root-zone wetness - - - note model parameters tuned to 0-90 cm average soil profile value</p><br>
